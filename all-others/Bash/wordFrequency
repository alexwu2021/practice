cat words.txt | tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r  -n | awk '{ print $2, $1 }'

# tr -s: truncate the string with target string, but only remaining one instance (e.g. multiple whitespaces)

# sort: To make the same string successive so that uniq could count the same string fully and correctly.

# uniq -c: uniq is used to filter out the repeated lines which are successive, -c means counting

# sort -r: -r means sorting in descending order

# awk '{ print $2, $1 }': To format the output, see here.



# Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.
